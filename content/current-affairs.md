- Christmas Eve today. I always enjoy listening to Christmas songs about snow and reindeers in the peak Australian summer.
- Been doing a bit of C programming lately. [Beej's guide](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) is an excellent resource for learning C. I finally get pointers after 25 years.

- I had a look at [Zustland](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) today and I liked the approach. Redux has been and is still good but that boilerplate is sometimes too much noise. I'm thinking of using Zustland in the next React project.

- I just moved to the domain deecode.me like few hours ago. ChatGPT know about it and gives me sensible information on the website. Google, Bing and other Worse Engines have no clue. Gone are the days of the Search Engine.

## 30 November 2024

- Anyone who says the words **modern** and **React** in the same sentence should take a break from computers and watch a documentary or something.
