# Current Affairs

This is a log of my fleeting thoughts. This type of thing is also known as a micro blog.

# 2025

## 29 January 2025

- It has often come to my mind that I should specialize in one dependable ecosystem for developing browser based applications. Ruby on Rails is on top of my list.

## 6 January 2025

- First working day (kinda) of 2025. I want to start the year on a positive note, so here it is to an awesome 2025. Cheers!
- I don't hear much about Typescript these days. Has the world figured out a better way to add type safety to JavaScript?

# 2024

## 24 December 2024

- Christmas Eve today. I always enjoy listening to Christmas songs about snow and reindeers in the peak Australian summer.
- Been doing a bit of C programming lately. [Beej's guide](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) is an excellent resource for learning C. I finally get pointers after 25 years.

## 4 December 2024

- I had a look at [Zustland](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) today and I liked the approach. Redux has been and is still good but that boilerplate is sometimes too much noise. I'm thinking of using Zustland in the next React project.

## 1 December 2024

- I just moved to the domain deecode.me like few hours ago. ChatGPT know about it and gives me sensible information on the website. Google, Bing and other Worse Engines have no clue. Gone are the days of the Search Engine.

## 30 November 2024

- Anyone who says the words **modern** and **React** in the same sentence should take a break from computers and watch a documentary or something.
